titleAbout= About ADTop
aboutText= ADTop is a software tool for risk treatment. It facilitates the automated selection \nof preventive security controls. It optimises ADTrees while automatically adding \nthe appropriate countermeasures based on an association matrix and a defence \nlibrary. \n \nADTop is a generator of optimal ADTrees based on cost-benefit analysis, in \nparticular the Return On Security Investment (ROSI) optimisation problem, and \nusing constraints such as the maximum security budget or the maximal residual \nsuccess probability of a risk scenario.\n \nYear: 2016 Version: 1.0 \nCopyright © {0} itrust consulting - All Rights Reserved
